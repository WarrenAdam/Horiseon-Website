# Horiseon-Website

## Description
In this challenge, students need to make the Horiseon website more accesible. The objective in this challenge is to refactor the code for the media agency, Horiseon. Code refactoring is important because it makes the code cleaner without changing what the website is designed to do. To make the code cleaner, we use semantic HTML tags and correlate the semantiic tags with the CSS styling to make it easier for screen-readers to understand the different sections of the code. Upon completing this challenge, I learned that it is important to add semantic tags in steps, to ensure you have the correct tag for your CSS styling selceto, class or id.
